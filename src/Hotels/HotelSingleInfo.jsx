            We had a lovely time staying at Sterling Goa Varca Resort. The rooms
            were great and the food in the dining area was also amazing. They
            had a lovely indoor pool and a lot of other activities which you
            could do right there in the resort. The beach was a short walk from
            the resort and was really lovely. I strongly recommend this place
            for people who want to have a nice, quiet, easy time visiting Goa
            for its beauty and beach experience.

            Beautiful stay! Hotel Arthur is a perfect place to stay in. It is
            close to the barca beach. The room was very pleasant, it was cozy
            and clean. Breakfast was good.The full hotel team has always been
            friendly, patient and helpful. That impressed me the most.They have
            holiday outdoor activities for kids and Adults which was amazing

            Even though you can go here n think you have arrived to a great
            beach . You won't. The property folks think they are gods and won't
            even give you a bottle of water. Apparently a box of ice is charged
            200 bucks. Worst part is the food. Prefer ordering it from Zomato.
            Would never ever go there. Worse than a haunted place

            Avoid this resort. I booked expecting it to be good since a Sterling
            property. The rooms are big, have a balcony and airy but that's it!
            Maintenance is very poor. AC didn't work properly on 1st day and
            after several follow ups it was fixed the next evening.
